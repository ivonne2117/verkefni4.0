        Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (born March 10, 1994), known by his stage name Bad Bunny, is a Puerto Rican singer, rapper, and songwriter. His music is often defined as Latin trap and reggaeton, but he has incorporated various other genres into his music, including rock, bachata, and soul. He is also known for his deep, slurred vocal style and his eclectic fashion sense. Throughout his career, Bad Bunny has frequently collaborated with artists such as J Balvin, Ozuna, Farruko, Residente, Arcángel, and Daddy Yankee.
        Born and raised in the municipality of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny gained popularity on SoundCloud and was eventually signed to a record label while working in a supermarket as a bagger and studying at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Following the release of his breakthrough single "Soy Peor" in late 2016, he rose to stardom after collaborating with Cardi B and Drake on the singles "I Like It" and "Mia", which charted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number one and number three, respectively. His debut album X 100pre (2018) was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album. His collaborative album with J Balvin, Oasis (2019), contains the popular singles "Qué Pretendes" and "La Canción".
        In early 2020, he performed at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show as a guest, alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez,[3] and became the first Latin urban music artist on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. Bad Bunny's second studio album, YHLQMDLG (Yo hago lo que me da la gana) (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the US Billboard 200 at number two, followed by the release of the compilation album Las que no iban a salir (2020), two months later without prior announcement or promotion.

        Benito Antonio Martínez was born on March 10, 1994, in Almirante Sur barrio in Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.[4] His father, Tito, was a truck driver, and his mother, Lysaurie, is a retired schoolteacher.[5][6] His mother often listened to salsa, merengue, and ballads, such as Juan Gabriel's "Abrázame muy fuerte" while Bad Bunny helped her with chores around the house.[7][8] He has two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael,[6] and considers his close friends to be part of his family. He said he was raised in a happy home.[8] As "a lanky wallflower with a booming voice", the rapper has described himself as a child by saying, “I wasn't the kid who got involved in the streets. I liked to be at home with my family.”[9]
        Bad Bunny says he has wanted to be a singer since he was young.[10] As a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[6] His first solo performance was his rendition of Juanes's song "Mala Gente" in a middle school talent show.[9] His stage name came from a time in which the rapper was forced to wear a bunny costume to school and was photographed with an angry expression.[7] Despite being shy in high school, he often created freestyle raps to entertain his classmates, developing a reputation at his school for his creativity and humor.[6] His teenage interests also included skateboarding and professional wrestling, both of which influenced his fashion sense.[6]
        Speaking about his distance from the Puerto Rican music industry, Bad Bunny stated "I'm from Vega Baja,  a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from. That's what's most surprising and incredible about this – I simply came from nothing, and that's that. When I was at school, I used to stay on a balcony singing and people would stand around listening."[11] He has stated that, when he was young, his mother wanted him to grow up to be an engineer, his father preferred that he be a baseball player, while a teacher told him that he would become a firefighter. Instead, he took courses in audiovisual communication at University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo.[12]
        While working as a bagger at Supermercados Econo in Vega Baja in 2016, Bad Bunny released music as an independent artist[10][13] on SoundCloud, where his song "Diles" caught the attention of DJ Luian who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[14] DJ Luian introduced Bad Bunny to the production team Mambo Kingz, who were intrigued by Bad Bunny's musical experimentation and style of dress.[15] Since then, he has earned multiple top-ten entries on the US Hot Latin Songs chart. His breakthrough single, "Soy Peor", established him as a forerunner in the Latin American trap scene and reached number 22 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[16] Ten months after the video for "Soy Peor"'s release, it reached 330 million views on YouTube.[16] His song "Krippy Kush" featuring Farruko also became a success, and was eventually remixed by American rapper Nicki Minaj.[15] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, "Ahora Me Llama", garnered more than 756 million views on YouTube and reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.[17] The song was described by Marty Preciado of NPR as a "bass-heavy, unapologetic trap anthem to the power of femininity, soiled in hi-hats and heavy sub-bass [that] challenges hegemonic masculinity, singing about respect, love and sex-positive decisions."[18] "Ahora Me Llama" was listed on "Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[18]
        In the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[19] He was featured in Becky G's single "Mayores", released in July 2017.[20] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, Trap Kingz.[21] Also in November 2017, Bad Bunny's track, "Tu No Metes Cabra" peaked at number 38 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[22] The re-mix demanded the release from prison of Anuel AA. At around the same time, the song "Sensualidad," released as a collaboration between Bad Bunny, J Balvin, and Prince Royce, peaked at number 8 on the Hot Latin Songs chart,[23] while the remix of "Te Boté" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on that chart.[24] In the year 2017 alone, Bad Bunny featured on fifteen Billboard Hot Latin Songs-charting tracks.[15]
